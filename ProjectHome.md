RegexPal is a JavaScript regular expression tester implemented in JavaScript and available at [RegexPal.com](http://regexpal.com). It includes real-time regex syntax and match highlighting. The regex syntax highlighting is more complex than you might expect, as it strives to be aware of all aspects of ECMA-262 3rd Edition regex syntax, and some browser-specific bugs, features, and limitations.

This project needs lots of help. Please contact me at steves\_list @ hotmail.com if you'd like to get involved. See the Issues tab for some ideas of features that need fixing / adding.
